# Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection

## Project Overview

### Introduction
The **VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection** project focuses on building an AI-based solution for detecting thoracic abnormalities from chest X-ray images. This project utilizes the **VinBigData dataset**, which includes a wide range of annotated chest conditions, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy in the medical field.

This project is based on the [VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/overview) hosted on Kaggle. The challenge invited over 1,200 teams to develop models that could classify and localize 14 thoracic abnormalities using 18,000 expert-annotated X-ray images.

By automating the detection process, this project helps reduce the workload on radiologists and speeds up diagnostics in healthcare systems, especially in environments with a high volume of cases. AIâ€™s consistency in analyzing medical images ensures accurate and reliable predictions, helping improve patient outcomes through early detection.

### Key Goals
- **Develop a robust AI model** capable of detecting 14 specific thoracic conditions, including aortic enlargement, atelectasis, and cardiomegaly.
- **Alleviate the workload on radiologists** by providing an AI-assisted tool that can quickly and accurately identify abnormalities in chest X-rays.
- **Ensure consistent and accurate diagnostic predictions**, improving the reliability of healthcare diagnostics and reducing variability in radiologic interpretation.
